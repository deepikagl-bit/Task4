# Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall (Windows / Linux)

**Objective:** Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.  
**Tools:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) for Linux, Windows Firewall (PowerShell / netsh) for Windows.  
**Deliverables:** Commands/configuration, test steps, and screenshots showing rules applied.

## How to use
1. Choose your OS directory (`linux/` or `windows/`).
2. Run the commands (instructions in each file). For Linux, you will need `sudo`.
3. Save screenshots into the `screenshots/` folder (names above) and commit them.
4. After completion, paste this repository link into the provided submission Google Form:
   `https://forms.gle/8Gm83s53KbyXs3Ne9`

## Notes & safety
- Do not expose remote services to the public Internet during testing.
- If you open or block ports, revert the test rules at the end (commands provided).

# Interview Questions â€” Answers

**1. What is a firewall?**  
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an applied rule set. It enforces a security policy to allow, deny, or log traffic between networks or hosts.

**2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?**  
- *Stateless firewall* filters packets based solely on packet headers (IP, port, protocol) and treats each packet independently.  
- *Stateful firewall* keeps track of connection state (e.g., TCP handshake) and uses state information to make more informed decisions, allowing return traffic from established connections automatically.

**3. What are inbound and outbound rules?**  
- *Inbound rules* control traffic coming into a host or network.  
- *Outbound rules* control traffic leaving a host or network.

**4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?**  
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) provides a simplified command-line interface for managing iptables rules. It abstracts complex iptables commands into simple allow/deny commands, supports named applications, and enables easy rule management for common tasks.

**5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?**  
Telnet transmits data (including credentials) in plaintext and lacks modern authentication and encryption. Blocking port 23 prevents insecure remote login and reduces risk of credential interception and unauthorized access.

**6. What are common firewall mistakes?**  
- Blocking management ports (e.g., SSH) without an alternate access method.  
- Leaving unnecessary ports open.  
- Misconfigured rules order (on devices where order matters).  
- Relying only on firewall without host hardening or monitoring.  
- Not logging or monitoring firewall events.

**7. How does a firewall improve network security?**  
A firewall enforces network access policies, reduces attack surface by limiting services/ports, prevents unauthorized access, and can log suspicious traffic for further analysis.

**8. What is NAT in firewalls?**  
NAT (Network Address Translation) translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for outgoing traffic. Firewalls often integrate NAT to allow internal hosts to access external networks while hiding internal addressing.
